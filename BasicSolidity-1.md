This is is summarized from PROGRAMMING HUB APP by myself 

GETTING STARTED 

  - Solidity 
  
        + Was designed to be easy to learn for programmers that are already familiar with one or more modern programming languages.

        + A JavaScript-like 

        + Created by Ethereum's team -> introduced in 2014

        + Is designed for developing smart contracts - run on EVM - Ethereum Virtual Machine 

        + Is compiled to bytecode that is executable on EVM 

        + Can create contracts for uses such as voting, crowdfunding, blind auctions, ....
  
  - EVM - Ethereum Virtual Machine :

        + A platform that makes creating decentralized applications easier 
        
        + Is a part of Ethereum that handles smart contract deployment and execution

        + Can access projects from anywhere in the world 

  - Why Solidity ?

        + Functional : Use for smart contracts , mostly take care of money-ralated needs 
        
        + Flexible : Can use a Remix Online or download a command-line complier on your PC 
        
        + Promising :  The world spends billions on Blockchain -> Solidity developers in Extremely hign demand 

        + Improving : Update constanly 

  - Solidity is a contract oriented programming language 

  - Smart contract 

        + A self-executing contract where the terms and conditions are defined and enforced using the software 

        + Stored and secured using blockchain technology

        + doing something automatically once conditions are met 

  - Looking at how a smart contract can be used 
        
        + Assume that John wants to buy Bill's House => Is formed on the Ethereum using a smart contract 

        + This smart contract contains an agreement between J and B - Look like this " WHEN J pays B 300$ , THEN J will receive ownership of the house 
          ( They have to pay lots of fees to 3rd party ( bank, lawer, house broker ) if they dont use Smart_contract ) 
          
        + No more commissions and no more delays to wait for a lawer, broker process
